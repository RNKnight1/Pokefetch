## How to use it
This script currently asks for the pokedex number of the pokemon you'd like
to get information about, then it will get the picture and some related
information such as type, abilities, weaknesses, etc.

## To-do
1) Change search to work by looking up name instead of pokedex number

2) Allow pokemon name to be entered as command-line argument

3) Print the information for the pokemon in a screenfetch/neofetch fashion, but replace OS logo with pokemon image and replace cpu information with pokemon name, stats, abilities, etc.
