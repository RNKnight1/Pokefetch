# Pokefetch

## How to use it
This script currently asks for the pokedex number of the pokemon you'd like
to get information about, then it will get the picture and some related
information such as type, abilities, weaknesses, etc.

## To-do
1) Print the information for the pokemon in a screenfetch/neofetch fashion, but replace OS logo with pokemon image and replace cpu information with pokemon name, stats, abilities, etc.

## Current progress
This is currently an example of what I have so far. I still need to:

1) Get the picture on left and text on right but my bash knowledge is minimal 

2) Need to access the image for every correct input, Pikachu.png is currently hard-coded
